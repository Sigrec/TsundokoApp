Previously in .NET Core 3.0, when a user runs your single file app, .NET Core host first extracts all files to a directory before running the application. .NET 5 improves this experience by directly running the code without the need to extract the files from the app.\r\n\r\nThe size of the single file in a self-contained application is large since it includes the runtime and the framework libraries. In .NET 6, you can publish trimmed to reduce the total size of trim-compatible applications. The single file deployment option can be combined with ReadyToRun and Trim publish options.",
