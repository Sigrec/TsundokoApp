### Please Fill Anything in <> Brackets
You can add as many staff members with roles as you want but I only accept roles valid roles from AniList but try and only do the major roles for instance Story, Art, Story & Art, Original Creator, etc

```json
"countryOfOrigin": "<series_country_of_origin>",
"title": {
  "romaji": "<romaji_title>",
  "english": "<english_title>",
  "native": "<native_title>"
},
"staff": {
  "edges": [
    {
      "role": "<role_name>",
      "node": {
        "name": {
          "full": "<romanization_name>",
          "native": "<native_name>"
        }
      }
      "role": "<role_name>",
      "node": {
        "name": {
          "full": "Tony Valente",
          "native": ""
        }
      }
    }
  ]
},
"description": "<series_description>",
"status": "<status>",
"siteUrl": "<series_link>",
"coverImage": {
  "extraLarge": "<web_image_link>"
}
```

I will comment after a submission first whether I can/will add your request and if I add it the version that includes this change
