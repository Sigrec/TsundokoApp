>Download the folder into your desired location, then pin the exe to your taskbar. Other standalone files are for if you only need to update a few things.
### Important Info
Do not delete or move any files that are inside this zip/folder, instead just pin the TsundOku.exe file to your taskbar

If you lose or delete the UserData.dat file u will lose your entire collection, so do not delete it, u will have to start over again, the Covers folder I also made visible incase u want to change the img shown for a particular series just make sure u copy the EXACT name and extension (either JPG or PNG) from the image file.
