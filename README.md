>Download the folder into your desired location (need to keep the executable file in a folder called "Tsundoku"), then pin the exe to your taskbar. Other standalone files are for if you only need to update a few things.
## Important
#### Usage
Do not delete or move any files that are inside this zip/folder, instead just pin the Tsundoku.exe file to your taskbar

If you lose or delete the UserData.dat file u will lose your entire collection, so do not delete it, u will have to start over again, the Covers folder I also made visible incase u want to change the img shown for a particular series just make sure u copy the EXACT name and extension (either JPG or PNG) from the image file.
#### Reporting Bugs/Issues
To report a issue please go to the issues link [Tsundoku Issues](https://github.com/Sigrec/TsundokuApp/issues) and create a issue ticket explaining the problem and how I can reproduce it. You can check back anytime to see if the ticket is completed and what version the change was made in.
