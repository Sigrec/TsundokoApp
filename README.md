Download the folder into your desired location (need to keep the executable folder with your UserData.json and Covers folder otherwise it will generate new ones), then pin the exe to your taskbar. Make sure to keep the ExtraSeries.json file in the same folder as well otherwise it will crash if you try and add any series in it like "Radiant"

## Important
### P.S. This Application is Something I Do For Fun during my Free Time
### Usage
1. After downloading the executable (Tsundoku.exe) place it in a folder which I would name Tsundoku then u can place that folder wherever you like.
2. Pin the executable to the taskbar for easy access (can drag the exe to the taskbar)
3. Do not delete or move any files that are inside the folder in which the "Tsundoku.exe" is, instead just pin the Tsundoku.exe file to your taskbar
4. If you lose or delete the UserData.json file u will lose your entire collection, so do not delete it, u will have to start over again, the Covers folder I also made visible incase u want to change the img shown for a particular series just make sure u copy the EXACT name and extension (either JPG or PNG) from the image file.

### Reporting Bugs/Issues
To report a issue please go to the issues link [Tsundoku Issues](https://github.com/Sigrec/TsundokuApp/issues) and create a issue ticket explaining the problem and how I can reproduce it. You can check back anytime to see if the ticket is completed and what version the change was made in.

### Removing Annoying Windows Defender
Of course I understand if you do not trust me but I promise there is nothing malicious in the executable. The windows defender should turn off after the first time you run it but in case it does not here is a link to add an exclusion [Windows Security Exclusion](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26)
